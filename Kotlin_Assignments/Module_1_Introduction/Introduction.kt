* 1. What is software.
* Ans. Software is a set of instructions, programs, or data that tells a computer or other device what to do and how to do it.
*   Software makes it easier to interact with devices and allows users to access new features and capabilities. For example,
*   software allows users to create graphics, edit videos, and play games without needing to know how the computer's hardware works.
*   Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of
*   hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer.
*
* 2. Types of application.
* Ans. Applications can be categorized into several types based on their purpose and functionality.
* Here are some common types:
*
* Web Applications: e.g., Google Docs, Facebook.
*
* Mobile Applications: e.g., Instagram, Uber.
*
* Desktop Applications: e.g., Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop.
*
* Enterprise Applications: e.g., Salesforce, SAP.
*
* Gaming Applications: e.g., Fortnite, Candy Crush.
*
* Utility Applications: e.g., antivirus software, file management tools.
*
* Educational Applications: e.g., Duolingo, Khan Academy.
*
* Social Media Applications: e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn.
*

* Ans.
* Criterion                     	Web apps	                               Mobile apps

* Functionality	        Support simple functionality	           Support complex functionality

* Cost of development	Are usually lower in comparison to         Are usually higher in comparison with web apps
*                       mobile apps due to the common code base	   due to platform-specific requirements
*
* Time-to-market	    Are faster to develop	                   The development may take a longer time especially if
*                                                                  you want to launch your app on different platforms
*
* Updates	            Don’t involve downloading	                Users need to download an updated version

* Downloading	        Don’t need.	                                Need downloading

* Monetization       	Are complicated	                            Strategies are still evolving

* Ease of use	        Usually perform slower than mobile apps	    Can work offline

* Discoverability	    Less discoverable as there is no market     Less discoverable as there is no marketplace for
*                       place for web apps.	                        web apps Can be found by searching for relevant keywords
*                                                                   on app marketplaces
* 4. Who developed Android ?
* Ans. Android was developed by Android Inc., which was founded in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears,
* and Chris White. In 2005, Google acquired Android Inc., and since then, Android has been developed and maintained by
